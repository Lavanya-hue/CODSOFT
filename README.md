Welcome to my AI/ML journey, where Iâ€™m diving deep into some fascinating projects are: 
1. Iris Flower Classification
2. Sales Prediction
3. Titanic Survival Prediction

--> Starting with the Iris Flower Classification, I built a simple powerful logistic regression model to predict the type of Iris flower based on its features like petal length and sepal width.
Using the well-known Iris dataset, the model can able to classify flowers into Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica.

--> Moving on to Sales Prediction, I took a business-oriented approach by creating a linear regression model that predicts future sales based on past data.
This project showcases how companies can use data to forecast trends and maximize their profits.

--> Lastly, the Titanic Survival Prediction project.
trained a model that predicts whether a passenger would survive the tragic Titanic disaster, based on their age, class, and fare paid.
